  <h1>Method Aliases In Ruby</h1>

  </p>
  <p>I often find myself wondering why so many of the Ruby native string and array methods have aliases. For example, with string methods, we have <code>next</code> and <code>succ</code>, which are equivalent; they both return the next alphanumeric character. Like so:</p>

<pre><code>1.9.3p194 :024 &gt; string = &quot;a&quot;
 =&gt; &quot;a&quot; 
1.9.3p194 :025 &gt; string.next
 =&gt; &quot;b&quot; 
1.9.3p194 :026 &gt; string
 =&gt; &quot;a&quot; 
1.9.3p194 :027 &gt; string.succ
 =&gt; &quot;b&quot;   </code></pre>

<p>So why do we need both? Here is another example. <code>length</code> and <code>size</code> are also synonymous. Both return the character length of a string.</p>

<pre><code>1.9.3p194 :028 &gt; a = &quot;supercalifragilisticexpealidocious&quot;
 =&gt; &quot;supercalifragilisticexpealidocious&quot; 
1.9.3p194 :029 &gt; a.size
 =&gt; 34 
1.9.3p194 :030 &gt; a.length
 =&gt; 34 </code></pre>

<p>This is perplexing to me. As much as I love Ruby, I often think that my mind philosophically prefers Python&#8217;s approach. The following is a direct quote from <a href='http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/'>&#8216;The Zen of Python&#8217;</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#8217;t necessarily have an answer (other than the likelihood that one or the other will be more familiar to programmers coming from other languages), but here&#8217;s a thought. We&#8217;re not working in Python, so let&#8217;s embrace the fact that Ruby has two ways of doing things sometimes.</p>

<p>If we think intuitively, it seems to me that we would want to find the &#8216;size&#8217; of an alphanumeric string like, for instance, a base 64 token. That, to me, makes more intuitive sense than to get the &#8216;length&#8217; of it. <code>length</code>, to me, seems to be the method we would want to use to find the length of a word, where the word &#8216;size&#8217; (and method of the same name) don&#8217;t make as much lexical sense.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>1.9.3p194 :018 &gt; token = SecureRandom.urlsafe_base64
 =&gt; &quot;OFiTxLeCuosWXiLe9nVLeQ&quot; 
1.9.3p194 :019 &gt; token.size
 =&gt; 22 </code></pre>

<p>Compare that to this:</p>

<pre><code>1.9.3p194 :022 &gt; sentence = &quot;An incredibly long sentence about whosits and whatsits&quot;
 =&gt; &quot;An incredibly long sentence about whosits and whatsits&quot; 
1.9.3p194 :023 &gt; sentence.length
 =&gt; 54  </code></pre>

<p>Doesn&#8217;t that just make more sense? To me, it seems more expressive.</p>

<p>Just to reiterate, whereas a developer coming from Python might be tempted to use one or the other method uniformly throughout a project, I like to think that Ruby&#8217;s features lend themselves well to expressiveness, and I would prefer using one method or the other in the context it makes sense. After all, we work in a language with this syntax:</p>

<pre><code>3.times do &#39;Hello World!&#39;</code></pre>

<p>This is as close to spoken English as I&#8217;ve ever seen programming syntax. So let&#8217;s write Ruby like we would speak, and use methods where they make sense contextually, even if they do the same thing. As a result, our code will be eaiser to read, and therefore maintain. That&#8217;s why we have the canonical saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8216;Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.&#8217; - H. Abelson and G. Sussman <em>&#8220;The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That sounds good, but let&#8217;s make this a little bit more complex. Look what happens when we make our string an array. <code>size</code> and <code>length</code> still apply, but to count the number of items in an array we also have, you guessed it, <code>count</code>. Check this out:</p>

<pre><code>1.9.3p194 :017 &gt; sentence = &quot;An incredibly long sentence about whosits and whatsits&quot;
 =&gt; &quot;An incredibly long sentence about whosits and whatsits&quot; 
1.9.3p194 :018 &gt; a = sentence.split(&#39; &#39;)
 =&gt; [&quot;An&quot;, &quot;incredibly&quot;, &quot;long&quot;, &quot;sentence&quot;, &quot;about&quot;, &quot;whosits&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;whatsits&quot;] 
1.9.3p194 :019 &gt; a.size
 =&gt; 8 
1.9.3p194 :020 &gt; a.length
 =&gt; 8 
1.9.3p194 :021 &gt; a.count
 =&gt; 8 </code></pre>

<p>So when should we use which? According to the <a href='http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Array.html#method-i-length'>Ruby docs</a>, <code>size</code> and <code>length</code> are truly the same, but <code>count</code> can take a block, and will return the number array items that give a true value. So let&#8217;s look at our previous example with this in mind:</p>

<pre><code>1.9.3p194 :027 &gt; a
 =&gt; [&quot;An&quot;, &quot;incredibly&quot;, &quot;long&quot;, &quot;sentence&quot;, &quot;about&quot;, &quot;whosits&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;whatsits&quot;] 
1.9.3p194 :028 &gt; a.count
 =&gt; 8 
1.9.3p194 :029 &gt; a.count(&#39;long&#39;)
 =&gt; 1 
1.9.3p194 :030 &gt; a.count(&#39;hello&#39;)
 =&gt; 0 </code></pre>

<p>So while <code>count</code> can return the number of array elements, it also has this added feature of <code>count</code>ing the number of passed in items the array elements match.</p>

<p>Thus, the only rule I can think of when working with arrays is to choose <code>size</code> or <code>length</code> and work with it throughout a project to return the number of array items, but only use <code>count</code> when you need to pass in a block so that there is no confusion about why you used differerent methods in different places to do the same job. This will lend to more cohesion and more expressiveness.</p>

<h2 id='gotchas'>Gotchas</h2>

<p>There are, of course, some gotchas to this idea. When I first started writing Ruby, I was so in love with the English-like syntax that, for a time, I decided I wanted to use words instead of symbols for conditional operators. Thus, I might&#8217;ve at one point been prone to write:</p>

<pre><code>def greeting
  if user.logged_in? and not(user.nil?)
    &quot;Welcome back, #{user.name}&quot;
  end
end</code></pre>

<p>That was a contrived example, for sure, and an exaggeration, but I wanted to get to this point: While researching the logical operators, I found a <a href='http://blog.internautdesign.com/2007/5/30/ruby-operator-precedence-gotcha-logical-and'>case</a> where <code>and</code> and <code>&amp;&amp;</code> returned different values:</p>

<pre><code>1.9.3p194 :013 &gt; result = true and false; result
 =&gt; true 
1.9.3p194 :014 &gt; result = true &amp;&amp; false; result
 =&gt; false</code></pre>

<p>That scared me enough to make me want to use symbolic logical operators all the time and sometimes parenthesis just to communicate intent. I now do this even when not strictly necessary:</p>

<pre><code>def viewable_by?(current_user)
  current_user.system_admin? || ( current_user.logged_in? &amp;&amp; current_user.owner? )
end</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the parenthesis weren&#8217;t absolutely necessary, as can be seen when we boil this example down:</p>

<pre><code>1.9.3p194 :024 &gt; false || true &amp;&amp; true
 =&gt; true</code></pre>

<p>But I use parenthesis anyway. I don&#8217;t sacrifice the aesthetics of the code (in my opinion, anyway), and that way, my code intentions become immediately more clear. And isn&#8217;t that the goal?</p>
