  <h1>Refactoring Cucumber</h1>
  <p class="meta">
    17 December 2012 
    
  </p>
  <p>At work, we&#8217;ve been moving away from Cucumber tests for the past number of months, in favor of the more robust Capybara and rspec paring. Given that I&#8217;m a relative novice in Rails test-driven development, the supposed brittleness of Cucumber tests wasn&#8217;t immediately clear to me, so I did some digging, and came up with a <a href='http://aslakhellesoy.com/post/11055981222/the-training-wheels-came-off'>few</a> <a href='http://benmabey.com/2008/05/19/imperative-vs-declarative-scenarios-in-user-stories.html'>posts</a> that talk about the pitfalls of the &#8220;imperative&#8221; style of step writing for user stories. A solid example of this is Ben Mabey&#8217;s ancient, but still applicable post, <a href='http://benmabey.com/2008/05/19/imperative-vs-declarative-scenarios-in-user-stories.html'>&#8220;Imperative vs. Declarative Scenarios in User Stories&#8221;</a>. Mabey&#8217;s assertion is that it is too easy to rely too heavily on the built-in Cucumber web steps. For example:</p>

<pre><code>When I fill in Name with &#39;Alligator&#39;
And select Phylum as &#39;Chordata&#39;
And fill in Animal Class with &#39;Sauropsida&#39;
And fill in Order with &#39;Crocodilia&#39;
And fill in Family with &#39;Alligatoridae&#39;
And fill in Genus with &#39;Alligator&#39;
And check Lay Eggs
And click the Create button</code></pre>

<p>Here, Maybe suggests, the &#8220;story&#8221; part of the user story tends to get lost and mired in the technical details. I was heavily influenced by this post, and decided to do a little Cucumber refactoring at work to try out Mabey&#8217;s declarative style, which he demonstrates thusly:</p>

<pre><code>	Story: Animal Submission
	As a Zoologist
	I want to add a new animal to the site
	So that I can share my animal knowledge with the community
	
		Scenario: successful submission
		Given I&#39;m on the animal creation page
		When I add a new animal
		Then I should see the page for my newly created animal
		And the notice &#39;Thank you for your animal submission!&#39;</code></pre>

<p>As Mabey notes, it has more of the <a href='http://www.jbrains.ca/permalink/user-stories-a-ticket-for-a-conversation'>token for conversation</a> feel to it, and it&#8217;s immediately clear that it is more likely to meet the user&#8217;s need, since, in this case, the user cares more about completing their goals than how those goals are handled on the back end.</p>

<h2 id='my_attempt'>My Attempt</h2>

<p>I took Mabey&#8217;s advice to our own codebase, and I extracted a Cucumber test that I had written a few months back. Now, I won&#8217;t start to bad mouth my code and talk endlessly about how terrible a person I am for having written it this way, but I&#8217;ll give you a taste of how poorly this test spoke to the user&#8217;s need. I present to you this feature test for our site&#8217;s feedback form:</p>

<pre><code>	#features/feedback.feature
Feature: Feedback
Scenario: Submitting feedback
	Given I go to the feedback page
	And I fill out the feedback form and submit it	
	Then I should see a success message
	Then I should see &quot;Email can&#39;t be blank&quot;
	When I fill in &quot;Your email&quot; with &quot;nick@navigatingcancer.com&quot;
	And I fill in &quot;Summary&quot; with &quot;This site rules&quot;
	And I fill in &quot;What you observed&quot; with &quot;This site rules&quot;
	And I press &quot;Send&quot;
	Then the flash notice should be &quot;Thank you for your feedback! |
		We try to respond to questions and requests within one business day.&quot;
	And ruby FeedbackForm.last.email.should == &#39;nick@navigatingcancer.com&#39;
	And ruby FeedbackForm.last.content.should match &quot;This site rules&quot;</code></pre>

<p>Yep, you read that right. That&#8217;s a Ruby function inside of a Cucumber test. I wonder what user will be thinking of their form submission in terms of a Ruby method chain? Now here&#8217;s my improved version, written with Turnip and Capybara.</p>

<pre><code>#spec/acceptance/forms/feedback.feature&#39;
Feature: Feedback form

	As a user of the site
I want to be able to submit feedback about the site
So that I can report if something breaks

	@feedback
Scenario: Submitting feedback (successful)
	Given I go to the feedback page
	And I fill out the feedback form and submit it
	Then I should see a success message

#spec/acceptance/forms/feedback_steps.rb
require &#39;spec_helper&#39;
steps_for :feedback do
	step &#39;I go to the feedback page&#39; do
  	page.visit &#39;/feedback&#39;
	end

		step &#39;I fill out the feedback form and submit it&#39; do
 		page.click_button &#39;Send&#39;
 		page.should have_content &quot;Email can&#39;t be blank&quot;
 		page.fill_in &#39;Your email&#39;, with: &#39;joe@navigatingcancer.com&#39;
 		page.fill_in &#39;Summary&#39;, with: &#39;Just saying&#39;      		page.fill_in &#39;What you observed&#39;, with: &#39;I am awesome&#39;
  	page.click_button &#39;Send&#39;
	end

		step &#39;I should see a success message&#39; do
  	page.should have_content &quot;Thank you for your feedback! We try to respond to questions and requests within one business day.&quot;
 		FeedbackForm.last.email.should == &#39;joe@navigatingcancer.com&#39;
  	FeedbackForm.last.content.should match &#39;I am awesome&#39;
	end
end</code></pre>

<p>See how much more nicely that reads? Now the user story is really coherent. They go to the form and submit it, and they should get a success message. That&#8217;s truly how simple the step should be. Notice that I still handled the validation in Capybara. But the it&#8217;s not the user&#8217;s job to think about what should happen if they don&#8217;t submit the form correctly, it&#8217;s mine. Thus, I should handle that in the test logic that doesn&#8217;t involve the user story.</p>

<h2 id='onward'>Onward</h2>

<p>As a front-end developer coming to the TDD Rails world, Cucumber was helpful to me because it helped me to think about things from the browser&#8217;s perspective. The <a href='https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin'>gherkin syntax</a>, when used well, really does allow for expressive steps and user stories that invite collaboration with non-developers. But that syntax paired with Capybara&#8217;s more robust step handling make for a much clearer and well-executed test. Notably, the reason I went back to this test was that we had changed the UI for the form. Our previous form submitted an <a href='https://unfuddle.com/'>unfuddle</a> ticket, but we have recently switched our ticketing system to <a href='http://assembla.com'>Assembla</a>. Also, we added a few fields and renamed others. In this case, the Cucumber test (previous to the one I have posted) would have failed because it wouldn&#8217;t have been able to find the form labels it was looking for. <em>But the user story remained the same.</em> All the user wants to do is submit a feedback form. So rather than changing several tests to reflect this, why not only change the ones that are concerned on the back end? They&#8217;re easier to maintain, and as great as Cucumber was, I find that I prefer the Capybara-rspec approach when it comes to looking for content on the page. I&#8217;m looking forward to exploring this technique across our codebase during refactoring, and in the future.</p>
